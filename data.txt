What Is Physical Fitness?

Physical fitness encompasses many factors, including body composition, flexibility, and endurance, but it boils down to having sufficient energy and physical strength to complete tasks. Maintaining physical fitness may contribute to a better quality of life, overall longevity, and lower blood pressure, in addition to potentially decreasing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.

3 Types of Physical Fitness

Your body’s overall fitness consists of three parameters, and your fitness program should ideally reflect that (in addition to incorporating all of the major muscle groups) to help you achieve full-body fitness:

    1. Aerobic or cardiovascular fitness: Aerobic fitness is your body’s ability to pump oxygenated blood through your blood vessels, especially as you engage in activities that raise your heart rate for an extended period. If you’re able to perform cardio—like running, swimming, or biking—for long stretches, you have a high level of aerobic fitness.
    2. Muscle-strengthening or anaerobic fitness: Anaerobic fitness is how much work your muscles can take on (and for what length of time) without needing rest and is reflected in your total muscle mass. Strength training increases anaerobic fitness, so being able to bench press beyond your body weight or perform many squats in a row can indicate your anaerobic fitness level.
    3. Flexibility: Your muscles shorten after physical activity and exertion; flexibility measures how much stretch your muscles have. You can improve your flexibility through regular stretching and flexibility exercises like yoga. 

5 Components of Fitness

Holistic physical fitness breaks down along the following lines and incorporates many types of exercise to address all five components of physical fitness:

    1. Body composition: Body composition generally refers to your body’s overall fat content. While body mass index (BMI) is a rough indication of fitness in relation to body composition, it also leaves out many factors that contribute to overall physical health and wellness. Consider your body fat content as only one small part of your overall fitness.
    2. Cardiovascular or cardiorespiratory endurance: Cardiovascular endurance measures how long your body can sustain physically taxing aerobic exercise. For example, a sprinter who can run fast but only for a short period doesn’t necessarily have high cardiovascular endurance. They could, however, incorporate sprinting into an interval training routine that alternates sprinting with rest for a longer period; doing so would build up cardiovascular endurance.
    3. Flexibility: Your flexibility amounts to how close you can get to exercising a full range of motion for your muscles. The sit and reach test, in which you extend your legs straight in front of you and reach with both hands toward your toes, is a classic measure of flexibility.
    4. Muscular endurance: Muscular endurance is distinct from muscular strength because it’s a matter of how long your muscles can perform work without rest. For example, performing many sit-ups or push-ups indicates muscular endurance, whereas powerlifting with very heavy weights does not.
    5. Muscular strength: You can measure your muscular strength by the maximal force produced by a given muscle or muscle group. Incorporating a weight-training program with increasingly heavier weights into your fitness training can help you build up muscle strength over time. 

How to Work out Safely and Avoid Injury

If you have a previous or pre-existing health condition, consult your physician before beginning an exercise program. Proper exercise technique is essential to ensure the safety and effectiveness of an exercise program. Still, you may need to modify each exercise to attain optimal results based on your individual needs. Always select a weight that allows you to control your body throughout the movement completely. When performing any exercise, pay close attention to your body, and stop immediately if you note pain or discomfort.

To see continual progress and build body strength, incorporate proper warm-ups, rest, and nutrition into your exercise program. Your results will ultimately be based on your ability to recover from your workouts adequately. Rest for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before training the same muscle groups to allow sufficient recovery.
